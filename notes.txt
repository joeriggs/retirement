- Pre-retirement loop:
    1. Calculate earnings.  Create a generic calculation function that can be
       used for each type of account.

       A. Create a generic function that can be used for each type of
          account.  It requires the following information:
          a. The current balance of the account.
          b. The asset allocation of the account.
          c. Interest rate for each asset type that is held in the account.
          d. Pass the information as (accountName).
             * The accountName should be associated with a previously-defined
               account that contains the asset allocation and balance.
             * Let the function obtain the earningsRateXXX for the assets.

       B. Different types of accounts have different asset allocations, so
          calculate each account separately.

       C. Taxable accounts:
          a. Some earn interest (CD, checking, savings).
          b. Some earn dividends or capital gains.

       D. Tax deferred:
          a. Part of the money will be in stocks.
          b. Part of the money will be in bonds.

       E. Tax free:
          a. All in stocks.

    2. Add new contributions.  Different amounts go into each investment.  For
       example:
       A. 25,000 into each 401(k).
       B.  7,000 into each ROTH.
       C. Remainder going into brokerage account.

- Post retirement loop:
    1. Calculate earnings.  Same as described above.

    2. Calculate regular expenses.

    3. Withdrawal strategy.
       A. Calculate RMD for person1.
       B. Calculate RMD for person2.
       C. Withdrawal (if necessary) from taxable accounts.
       D. Withdrawal (if necessary) from tax deferred accounts.
       E. Withdrawal (if necessary) from tax free accounts.

    4. Rebalance.
       A. Shift between accounts if necessary.
       B. Remember any withdrawals for tax calculation purposes.

    5. Calculate taxes.  Each savings type is taxed separately.  In other
       words:
       A. Tax the interest, dividends, and capital gains from taxable
          accounts.  Don't tax the basis.
       B. Straight up regular income tax on IRA and 401(k) withdrawals.
       C. No taxes on ROTH.

    6. Recalculate taxes to include all money removed from steps 3 and 4.
       You have to pay taxes on your withdrawals, including the money you
       withdrawal to pay your taxes.

    7. Calculate medical expenses.

- Keep the "savingsBalance" in an object that breaks the savings out into the
  different types (taxable, tax deferred, and tax free).

- Replace a bunch of the dictionary types with array, using dates or ages as
  the index.

- ROTH conversion prior to 70 1/2.

- ROTH conversion after 70 1/2.  Probably N/A.

- RMD consideration for annual "withdrawal".

- Different rate for each type of "Savings".

- Different asset allocation for each type of "Savings".

- Different "annualContribution" for each type of "Savings".

- Use historical averages of earnings for each type of investment account:
  - earningsRateChecking
  - earningsRateSavings
  - earningsRateCD
  - earningsRateBonds
  - earningsRateStocks

- Use historical data.  Grab the historical data going back as far as I can
  find, and use that in order to give a more realistic picture of how our
  portfolio will perform as the economy goes up and down.
  - Cash (savings and CDs).
  - Equities.
  - Bonds.
  - Inflation.
  - Medicare premiums.
  - Medicare supplement premiums.
